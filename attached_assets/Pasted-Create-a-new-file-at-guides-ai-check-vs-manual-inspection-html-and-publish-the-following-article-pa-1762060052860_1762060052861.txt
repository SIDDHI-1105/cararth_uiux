For decades, India’s used car market has relied on the human touch — the mechanic’s experience, the dealer’s instinct, and the buyer’s intuition. Those human skills built the industry. But at today’s scale, they need help.

## The Limits of Human-Only Verification
Manual inspections are valuable but subjective, often missing hidden issues like odometer tampering or unrecorded accident damage. These are not failures of people, but of process.

## How AI Complements, Not Replaces, Human Judgment
Cararth’s 200-Point AI Verification System extends human capability:
- **Computer Vision** detects subtle damage and repairs.
- **Document OCR** cross-verifies data with RTO and VAHAN.
- **Predictive Models** flag inconsistencies early.
- **Verification Logs** ensure transparency and traceability.
This isn’t automation replacing people — it’s technology protecting their diligence.

## From Inspection to Intelligence
When human experience and AI verification come together, the result is confidence grounded in evidence — not just opinion.

## The Future Is Human + AI
AI is not a substitute for expertise. It’s an amplifier. The future of trust in India’s used car market will be built on this partnership — **human diligence, AI verified.**
