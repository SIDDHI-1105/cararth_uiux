Hero Section (Top Fold)
Current:
“India’s First Used Car Search Engine. Discover cars from across platforms, compare smarter, and buy or sell with confidence. More than a marketplace — your guide, your community, your car's true value (arth).”
Recommended Update:
### Headline:
India’s First Used Car Search Engine  

### Subheading:
Search cars from every major platform in one place. Compare smarter, buy or sell with confidence, and discover your car’s true value (arth).  

### CTA (Primary Button):
🔵 [Search Cars] (Keep it very prominent)  

### CTA (Secondary Button):
⚪ [Sell Your Car] (Just beside primary, softer tone)  

*(Tip: Reduce line length of subheading for better readability.)*
✅ Trust Signals (Below Hero)
Current: Logos listed as text buttons (CarDekho, OLX, etc.).
Recommended Update:
### Add a "Trusted Sources" Bar:
Show logos of platforms you aggregate from (CarDekho, OLX, Cars24, Spinny, etc.)
➡ Better than plain text, it visually communicates trust instantly.  

Also add a badge:  
✔ "100% Verified Listings from Trusted Platforms"
✅ Filter Section (Search Bar)
Current: Dropdowns for Brand, Budget, City, Fuel Type.
Recommended Update:
### Improvements:
- Make filters horizontal and compact (one clean line).  
- Add placeholder hints like:  
   - Brand → "Maruti, Hyundai, Honda…"  
   - Budget → "₹3L – ₹10L"  
   - City → "Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai…"  
   - Fuel → "Petrol, Diesel, EV…"  

- Default behavior: If only one filter is chosen (e.g., budget), show results. Don’t force multiple filters.
