Prompt for Replit Agent: Build CarArth.com (SEO + UX Optimized Version)
We are developing cararth.com here on Replit.
I am not technical — please build and deploy the improved version based on this clear direction 👇
🎯 Goal
Make CarArth.com look professional, fast, and trustworthy — like India’s best AI-powered used car search engine.
The website should be:
Search-first (homepage hero)
SEO-optimized (Google can easily index it)
LLM-search friendly (so AI tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity understand it)
Visually clean and responsive on mobile and desktop
🛠️ What to Build
Use Next.js (preferred) or React + Vite — whatever runs easily on Replit.
Create these pages:
Homepage (/)
Big headline:
“CarArth — India’s AI-Powered Used Car Search Engine”
Subheading:
“No paid listings. Verified sellers. Unbiased results.”
Add a clear search bar right below with a blue Search Cars button.
Show filter chips below it: Price | Fuel | Year | City
Add a small trust line below:
✅ “No paid listings — unbiased results”
Must look perfect on mobile and desktop.
Sell Page (/sell)
Header: “Sell Your Car Once. Reach Everywhere.”
3-step progress bar at the top: 1. Details → 2. Verification → 3. Publish
Simple form:
Brand (dropdown)
Model (text input)
Year (dropdown)
Price (number)
Image upload with preview (client-side only)
Show a message below:
“AI verifies every listing — no paid promotions.”
Throttle Talk Page (/throttle-talk)
One blog article with title: “India Used Car Market: Data-Driven Overview”
Few lines of content and 3 data cards (Market Size, Digital Share, Platform Listings).
City Pages
/used-cars-in-hyderabad
/used-cars-in-delhi-ncr
Each page can have 2–3 sentences about local listings (just demo content).
📈 SEO + LLM Optimization
Add meta tags:
<title>Used Car Search Engine | CarArth — No Paid Listings</title>
<meta name="description" content="CarArth helps you find verified used cars across India with no paid listings — AI-powered and trustworthy.">
Add structured data (JSON-LD) for:
Organization (CarArth)
Service (Used Car Listing)
FAQPage (2 questions: What makes CarArth different? Does it charge sellers?)
BlogPosting (for Throttle Talk)
Add /public/sitemap.xml with links to the above pages.
Use proper headings: <h1>, <h2>, <section>, <article>, <nav> etc.
Ensure text and CTAs are crawlable (no hidden content).
