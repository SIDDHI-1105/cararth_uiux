🧠 REPLIT EXECUTION PROMPT: CARARTH.COM SELLER SYNDICATION — 100% AUTOMATION, COMPLIANCE-READY (PHASE 1 LAUNCH)
Title: Deploy 100% Automated, Compliance-Ready Seller Syndication System for CarArth.com (Phase 1: OLX, Quikr, Facebook Marketplace)
🎯 Objective
Enable CarArth.com to allow sellers to post a car once and have it automatically:
Verified and stored (with consent).
Populated under “Exclusive Listings” in the buyer section.
Syndicated across OLX Autos, Quikr Cars, and Facebook Marketplace automatically.
Tagged with “Powered by CarArth.com” on every external platform.
Audited, logged, and compliant with Indian intermediary and data laws (DPDP Act 2023).
All syndication must only proceed after seller consent and avoid duplication across platforms via AI checks.
⚙️ Tech Stack to Use
Frontend: React (Replit)
Backend: Flask (Python)
Database: PostgreSQL
Automation: Firecrawl + Apify
AI Layer: GPT-5, Gemini, Anthropic (Claude), Perplexity
Notifications: SendGrid or Gmail API
Hosting: Replit
🧩 Implementation Scope
1. Seller Form + Consent Flow
Add /sell page with fields:
Name, Email, Phone, Car Brand, Model, Variant, Year, Color, Fuel Type, Transmission, Mileage, Price, City, Upload Images.
Add mandatory checkbox + modal:
“I agree to CarArth.com’s Terms & Conditions and authorize CarArth.com to publish my listing across verified marketplaces (OLX, Quikr, Facebook Marketplace).”
Store consent metadata: seller_id, ip_address, timestamp, terms_version, consent_status=TRUE.
Link to /terms page.
2. Legal Disclaimer & /terms Page
Plain-language disclaimer:
“By submitting your vehicle for listing on CarArth.com, you authorize CarArth Technologies Pvt. Ltd. to publish your listing across verified marketplaces (OLX, Quikr, Facebook Marketplace). CarArth acts as an intermediary only — it does not modify, sell, or claim ownership of your content. You may withdraw consent anytime.”
T&C must include:
Consent and authority.
Scope of syndication.
Data handling and withdrawal clause.
Liability disclaimer.
Compliance under Indian IT and DPDP laws.
3. Database Setup (PostgreSQL)
Create tables:
sellers — seller info
listings — car details
consent_log — consent records
deduplication_log — duplicate check results
syndication_log — platform posting records
api_audit_log — outbound request/response logs
4. AI Deduplication Microservice
Before posting:
Firecrawl & Apify search existing listings (OLX, Quikr, Facebook).
Gemini compares attributes (make, model, year, price).
Claude validates context.
GPT-5 final decision — confidence score ≥ 0.85 → mark duplicate → skip syndication for that platform.
Log all results in deduplication_log.
5. Syndication Orchestrator (Automation Engine)
Create a Flask orchestrator to:
Accept standardized listing JSON (car_listing.json).
Convert to platform-specific payloads.
Append "Powered by CarArth.com" to titles/descriptions.
Post via:
OLX Autos: Apify actor or form automation.
Quikr Cars: JSON POST or Apify automation.
Facebook Marketplace: Facebook Graph API (requires verified CarArth business page).
Write all results to syndication_log and api_audit_log.
✅ Each post must include:
listing_id, platform, status, url, powered_by, timestamp.
6. Seller Notifications
After syndication:
Send email + dashboard update:
“Your car listing is now live on OLX Autos, Quikr, and Facebook Marketplace. Duplicate detected on [X] — skipped reposting.”
Include URLs, timestamps, and “Powered by CarArth.com” label.
7. Buyer Section Integration
Once seller submits → listing appears in Buyer Section → “Exclusive Listings” tab.
Badge: “Verified Listing — Powered by CarArth.com”.
Field: exclusive_show=true for verified, active listings.
8. Compliance & Audit
Maintain logs for every action in api_audit_log.
Store consent + IP in consent_log.
Add withdraw endpoint:
POST /api/listings/{id}/withdraw → marks listing withdrawn, attempts delist.
Add /admin/audit route for viewing API logs and platform status.
Ensure rate-limiting: one syndication per platform per listing (per minute).
9. Canonical JSON Schema (car_listing.json)
{
  "listing_id": "uuid",
  "seller_id": "uuid",
  "title": "Maruti Swift VXi 2019 - Excellent condition",
  "brand": "Maruti",
  "model": "Swift",
  "variant": "VXi",
  "year": 2019,
  "color": "White",
  "transmission": "Manual",
  "fuel_type": "Petrol",
  "mileage_km": 42000,
  "price_inr": 550000,
  "city": "Hyderabad",
  "description": "Well maintained, single owner, service history available.",
  "images": ["https://cdn.cararth.com/img1.jpg", "https://cdn.cararth.com/img2.jpg"],
