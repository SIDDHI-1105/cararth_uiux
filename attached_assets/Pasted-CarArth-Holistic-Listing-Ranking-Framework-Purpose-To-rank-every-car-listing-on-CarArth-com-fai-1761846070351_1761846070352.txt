CarArth Holistic Listing & Ranking Framework
🧠 Purpose
To rank every car listing on CarArth.com fairly and transparently using a Trust + AI-driven model that accounts for:
Market pricing accuracy
Listing recency
Demand for that specific make/model
Listing quality (images + details)
Seller credibility (AI / Dealer / User)
This score decides:
Ranking order (default sort: Most Trusted & Relevant)
Visibility weight in search results
UI trust cues (badges, ribbons, and microcopy)

🧮 Listing Score Formula
Weighted Components
Factor	Weight	Description
Pricing Fairness	30%	How close listing price is to average market price
Recency	15%	Freshness of listing (age decay after 30 days)
Demand	20%	Market demand for that model/variant
Completeness	15%	% of required fields and images filled

Sub-score Computation
1. Price Score
price_score = max(0, 1 - |list_price - avg_price| / avg_price) * 100
2. Recency Score
recency_score = max(0, 1 - days_since_listing / 30) * 100
3. Demand Score
demand_score = demandIndex * 100
4. Completeness Score
= percentage of required fields completed × 100
5. Image Quality Score
image_score = ((min(image_count, 5)/5)*0.4 + imageQualityAvg*0.6) * 100
6. Seller Trust Score
Seller Type	Trust Value	Score
CarArthX Ethical AI	0.95	95
CarArthX Exclusive Dealer	0.90	90
CarArthX User (verified)	0.85	85
Unverified User	0.60	60
Final Score Calculation
listingScore =
  (price_score * 0.30) +
  (recency_score * 0.15) +
  (demand_score * 0.20) +
  (completeness_score * 0.15) +
  (image_score * 0.10) +
  (seller_trust_score * 0.10)
