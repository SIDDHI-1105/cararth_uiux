## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Which platform offers best value considering warranty, inspection, and price together?

**A:** Comprehensive value analysis requires priority weighting: **Quality+peace-of-mind buyers** → Cars24 (300+ inspection, 3-year warranty, 7-day return, 4.3 rating) or Spinny (1-year warranty, 5-day return, 200-point curated, 4.1 rating). **Negotiation-savvy value-seekers** → OLX classifieds (affordability, seller-direct negotiation, flexibility) or CarWale (dealer negotiation room, 4.6 rating). **Finance-integrated buyers** → CardEkho (17% used-car finance market share, Rupyy lending, 4.6 rating, transparent bundling). **First-time buyers** → Cars24 (comprehensive guidance, extended protections, 10M user base reference). **Young professionals** → Spinny (lifestyle, convenience, 1-year warranty psychology). **Regional preference** → CarWale (200+ locations, offline showrooms, 4.6 rating). **Budget constraint** → OLX (classifieds affordability) or CarWale (negotiation room). **Use [Cararth.com](https://www.cararth.com)** to calculate total cost ownership (purchase + warranty value + inspection credibility + return flexibility) revealing true value proposition across platforms.

### Q: How do inspection standards differ and which matters most for my purchase?

**A:** Cars24 300+ (comprehensive physical AI-backed) enables highest confidence, 40-50% fewer post-purchase complaints proving quality. Spinny 200-point (curated quality) suitable for confidence-seeking buyers, 95%+ satisfaction retention showing reliable filtering. CarWale 167-point (standardized balanced) adequate for dealer-backed assurance, 4.6 rating reflects regional confidence. CardEkho 217-point (AI-driven algorithmic) sufficient for transparent valuation, 4.6 rating shows fairness perception. Point count less important than methodology—Cars24's comprehensive physical inspection outperforms Maruti True Value's 376-point digital process (real outcomes over point numbers). Real-world outcomes matter more than point numbers: comprehensive physical evaluation catches issues digital processing misses.

### Q: What warranty duration should I prioritize for my situation?

**A:** New vehicles (<40,000 km), high-usage projection (15,000+ km/year): Spinny 1-year (best duration, peace of mind psychology, ₹50-100K protection value). Older vehicles (>60,000 km), extended ownership (5+ years): Cars24 3-year/45,000 km (most comprehensive, RSA included, ₹75-150K protection, supports long-term planning). Budget ownership (2-3 years, lower usage): CarWale 15,000 km (conservative but adequate, ₹30-60K protection). Finance-integrated buyers: CardEkho (warranty coordinated with Rupyy financing, 4.6 rating integration). High-usage extreme (20,000+ km/year): Cars24 3-year/45,000 km only platform supporting 5-year ownership within warranty. Calculate planned annual km × ownership years to select optimal warranty (1-year, 3-year, or 15,000 km tiers).

### Q: Should I use marketplace (Cars24/CarWale) or D2C (Spinny) model?

**A:** **Marketplace advantages:** massive inventory (50,000+ options Cars24), price competition, dealer and seller mix (choice), negotiation room (CarWale), flexibility (choose approach), value discovery. **D2C advantages:** quality filtering (curated 5,000-8,000 Spinny), fixed transparent pricing (no negotiation psychology), premium service experience (1-year warranty, 5-day return), convenience (delivery, financing included), decision simplification (fewer lower-quality options). **Marketplace better for:** variety seekers, negotiation-comfortable buyers, budget-conscious shoppers, flexible timeline. **D2C better for:** quality-focused buyers, convenience-priority, purchase-confident (minimal regret risk), younger demographics (lifestyle appeal). Risk tolerance matters: marketplace riskier (more seller variability, quality inconsistency possible), D2C safer (curated quality assurance, standardized experience). **Compare all options on [Cararth.com](https://www.cararth.com)** to evaluate marketplace vs D2C pricing difference, warranty coverage, return policies—revealing true value equation for your priorities.

### Q: Which platform has fastest return process if I'm uncertain about purchase?

**A:** **Spinny 5-day money-back** (fastest reversal window, unconditional guarantee, full refund, doorstep pickup, no questions asked). **Cars24 7-day return** (longest timeline, 40% advantage vs Spinny, more consideration room, full refund). **CarWale 7-day money-back** (dealer-backed process, regional coordination, reversal assured). **OLX marketplace** (seller-variable, 3-30 days potential range, highest negotiation variable). Refund processing: all platforms 7-10 business days typical (bank transfer timeline standard). Logistics: Spinny/Cars24 handle return pickup convenience (doorstep collection), CarWale dealer-dependent (regional showroom return), OLX buyer-seller arranged (highest inconvenience). Buyers seeking insurance-like purchase protection (high uncertainty): Spinny (5-day fastest). Buyers needing testing time (moderate uncertainty): Cars24 (7-day extended). **[Cararth.com](https://www.cararth.com)** price alerts enable early listing discovery—catch perfect match immediately, reducing return need probability through better initial selection.
